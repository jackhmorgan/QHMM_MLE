Code for On Quantum and Quantum-Inspired Maximum Likelihood Estimation and Filtering of Stochastic Volatility Models by Ghysels, Morgan, and Mohammadbagherpoor. This repo is organized as follows:
- HMM holds the code for all the models discussed in the paper
  - QHMM_Example.ipynb shows an example workflow of using the HMM module
- causal_break_test.ipynb is the code that performed the causal break test in Figure 3.
- SPY_training.py is the code we used to train our empirical model
- PC_to_NPC_to_QHMM_Final.py is the code we used for our primary result in Figure 4.
